We have a dataset of a Bank with a sample of 10,000 customers with unusual churn rates and measured parameters like ID, surname, Credit Score, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance,
No Of Products, Active Member, Estimate salary, Exited etc. We are supposed to create a segmentation model to find out which cutomers have the highest risk of leaving. 
This segmentation model will be a powerful tool to find out various cases.
